Meanwhile, Rukeme is living in Urukpe, a town that is divided between Simbians and Zondans. She is ostracized by both sides for being married to a Simbian man. She is also harassed by Odibo, a Zondan soldier who lusts after her and wants to take her as his wife. Rukeme resists Odibo's advances and hopes to reunite with Toje someday.

He arrives at their house and is overjoyed to see them again. However, their reunion is short-lived as Odibo discovers Toje's presence and alerts the Zondan army. A fierce battle ensues between the Simbian and Zondan forces in Urukpe, resulting in many casualties and destruction. Toje, Rukeme, and Iddu try to flee from the chaos, but they are caught in the crossfire. The novel ends with a tragic climax that leaves their fate uncertain.
