The software comes with over 90 built-in models, but users can also define their own custom regression models. Users can compare their data to each model to find the best fit, and examine the results in detail using the query feature. The software also supports saving graphs in JPEG format, and has fixed a bug that affected the pan and zoom buttons for 3D plots.
 
CurveExpert Professional 1.6.5 is a cross-platform solution for curve fitting and data analysis that aims to generate high quality results and output while saving time in the process. It is available for purchase from [Hyams Development](https://www.curveexpert.net/products/curveexpert-professional/), where users can also find more information about the software's features, capabilities, gallery, testimonials, and documentation.

One of the main advantages of CurveExpert Professional 1.6.5 is its cross-platform compatibility. Users can buy the software once and use it on any of the three supported platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux. This allows users to work on their data analysis projects on different devices and operating systems without having to purchase multiple licenses or deal with compatibility issues.
 
Another benefit of CurveExpert Professional 1.6.5 is its user-friendly interface. The software has a simple and intuitive design that makes it easy to navigate and use. Users can import data from various file formats, such as CSV, Excel, text, and binary files, and view them in a spreadsheet-like format. Users can also plot their data using different types of graphs, such as line, scatter, bar, pie, contour, and surface plots, and customize their appearance using various options and tools.
 
A third feature of CurveExpert Professional 1.6.5 is its multivariate and multicore capabilities. The software can handle data sets with multiple independent and dependent variables, and perform multiple regression analyses simultaneously. The software also utilizes the multicore processors of modern computers to speed up the computation and optimization processes. This allows users to perform complex data analysis tasks faster and more efficiently.

In addition to the features mentioned above, CurveExpert Professional 1.6.5 also offers a number of other functionalities that make it a powerful and versatile software for curve fitting and data analysis. Some of these functionalities are:
 
- Built-in models: The software comes with over 90 built-in models that cover a wide range of applications, such as exponential, logarithmic, polynomial, trigonometric, hyperbolic, Gaussian, Lorentzian, and sigmoid functions. Users can also create their own custom models using the model editor.
- Ranking of results: The software can rank the results of the curve fitting process based on various criteria, such as coefficient of determination, root mean square error, Akaike information criterion, and Bayesian information criterion. Users can also sort and filter the results according to their preferences.
- Detailed result query: The software can provide detailed information about the results of the curve fitting process, such as parameter values, standard errors, confidence intervals, residuals, correlation matrix, covariance matrix, and ANOVA table. Users can also export the results to various file formats, such as CSV, Excel, text, HTML, and XML files.

These are some of the features that make CurveExpert Professional 1.6.5 a comprehensive and reliable software for curve fitting and data analysis. Users can download a free trial version of the software from [Hyams Development](https://www.curveexpert.net/products/curveexpert-professional/) to test its capabilities and performance before purchasing it.
